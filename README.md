# sansify
Permanently replaces every (ttf) font on your system with comic sans.

Do you love Comic Sans?  Like, really love it?  Well I have a script for you.
Place the font file called comic_sans.ttf in the same directory as this script, and
voila! Every font on your system is now comic sans.  If you really want, you
can have it use any (ttf) font and edit the name accordingly in the script.
It should be fully cross platform, although it has only been tested on linuxu.
Don't forget to run it with sudo/admin privileges!
